This is a list of historians.The names are grouped by order of the historical period in which they were living and producing works, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialize.[1]Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also listed here for convenience. Only historians with biographical articles in Wikipedia are listed here.See also: List of historians by area of study, List of historians of the French Revolution, English historians in the Middle Ages
