A geneticist is a biologist who studies genetics, the science of genes, heredity, and variation of organisms.A geneticist can be employed as a scientist or lecturer. Some geneticists perform experiments in model organisms such as Drosophila, C. elegans, Zebrafish, rodents or Humans and analyze data to interpret the inheritance of biological traits. A geneticist can be a scientist who has earned a Ph.D in Genetics or a physician (who has earned any of the following medical degrees: MBBS/MBChB (non-U.S.), D.O. (U.S.-only), or M.D.) who has been trained in genetics as a specialization. They evaluate, diagnose, and manage patients with hereditary conditions or congenital malformations, genetic risk calculations, and mutation analysis as well as refer patients to other medical specialties. The geneticist carries out studies, tests and counsels patients with genetic disorders.Geneticists participate in courses from many areas, such as biology, chemistry, physics, microbiology, cell biology, bioinformatics, and mathematics. They also participate in more specific genetics courses such as molecular genetics, transmission genetics, population genetics, quantitative genetics, ecological genetics, and genomics.Geneticists can work in many different fields, doing a variety of jobs. There are many careers for geneticists in medicine, agriculture, wildlife, general sciences, or many other fields.Listed below are a few examples of careers a geneticist may pursue.
