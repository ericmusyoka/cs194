Upper Macedonia (Greek: Ἄνω Μακεδονία, Ánō Makedonía) is a geographical and tribal term to describe the upper/western of the two parts in which, together with Lower Macedonia, the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon was roughly divided.[1][2][3] Upper Macedonia became part of the kingdom of Macedon in the early 4th century BC. From that date, its inhabitants were politically equal to Lower Macedonians. Upper Macedonia was divided in the regions of Elimeia, Eordaea, Orestis, Lynkestis, Pelagonia, Deuriopus, Atintania and Dassaretis.[4] The middle and southern parts of Upper Macedonia corresponds roughly to the modern Greek region of West Macedonia while the northern part of Upper Macedonia corresponds to the southwestern corner of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.Hecataeus and Strabo identified these mountain Macedonia kingdoms as of Epirote stock. Two of the most important Hellenistic dynasties originated from Upper Macedonia: the Lagids from Eordaea, and the Seleucids from Orestis.
