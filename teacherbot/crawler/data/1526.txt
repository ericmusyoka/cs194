The League of Corinth, also referred to as the Hellenic League (from Greek Ἑλληνικός Hellenikos, "pertaining to Greece and Greeks"[1]), was a federation of Greek states created by Philip II of Macedon during the winter of 338 BC/337 BC after the Battle of Chaeronea, to facilitate his use of military forces in his war against Persia. The name 'League of Corinth' was invented by modern historians due to the first council of the League being in Corinth. It was the first time in history that most of the Greek states (with the notable exception of Sparta) managed to become part of a single political entity.[2]The League was governed by the Hegemon (strategos autokrator in a military context),[3] the Synedrion (council) and the Dikastai (judges). Decrees of the league were issued in Corinth, Athens, Delphi, Olympia and Pydna.[4] The League maintained an army levied from member states in approximate proportion to their size, while Philip established garrisons (commanded by phrourarchs, or garrison commanders) in Corinth, Thebes, and Ambracia.(A fragmentary inscription found in Athens)[5][6]․․․․․․․․․․22․․․․․․․․․․ς ἐμμεν[ῶ ․․․․] ․․․․․․․․․․22․․․․․․․․․․νον[τ]ας τ․․․․ [․․․․․․․․18․․․․․․․․ οὐδ]ὲ ὅπλα ἐ[π]οί[σω ἐ]- [πὶ πημονῆι ἐπ’ οὐδένα τῶν] ἐμμενόντ[ω]ν ἐν τ- [οῖς ὅρκοις οὔτε κατὰ γῆν] οὔτε κατὰ [θ]άλασ- [σαν· οὐδὲ πόλιν οὐδὲ φρο]ύριον καταλήψομ- [αι οὔτε λιμένα ἐπὶ πολέ]μωι οὐθενὸς τῶν τ- [ῆς εἰρήνης κοινωνούντ]ων τέχνηι οὐδεμι- [ᾶι οὔτε μηχανῆι· οὐδὲ τ]ὴν βασιλείαν [τ]ὴν Φ- [ιλίππου καὶ τῶν ἐκγόν]ων καταλύσω ὀδὲ τὰ- [ς πολιτείας τὰς οὔσας] παρ’ ἑκάστοις ὅτε τ- [οὺς ὅρκους τοὺς περὶ τ]ῆς εἰρήνης ὤμνυον· [οὐδὲ ποιήσω οὐδὲν ἐνα]ντίον ταῖσδε ταῖς [σπονδαῖς οὔτ’ ἐγὼ οὔτ’ ἄλ]λωι ἐπιτρέψω εἰς [δύναμιν, ἀλλ’ ἐάν τις ποε̑ι τι] παράσπονδ[ον] πε- [ρὶ τὰς συνθήκας, βοηθήσω] καθότι ἂν παραγ- [γέλλωσιν οἱ ἀεὶ δεόμενοι] καὶ πολεμήσω τῶ- [ι τὴν κοινὴν εἰρήνην παρ]αβαίνοντι καθότι [ἂν ἦι συντεταγμένον ἐμαυ]τῶι καὶ ὁ ἡγε[μὼ]- [ν κελεύηι ․․․․․12․․․․․ κα]ταλείψω τε․․ — — — — — — — — — — — — — ∶𐅃 [— — — — — — — — — — ∶ Θεσ]σαλῶν ∶Δ [— — — — — — — — — — — ῶ]ν ∶ΙΙ [— — — — — — — — — Ἐλειμ]ιωτῶν ∶Ι [— — — — Σαμοθράικων καὶ] Θασίων ∶ΙΙ — — — — — — — — — ων ∶ΙΙ∶ Ἀμβρακιωτ[ῶν] [— — — — — — — ἀ]πὸ Θράικης καὶ [— — — — — ∶] Φωκέων ∶ΙΙΙ∶ Λοκρῶν ∶ΙΙΙ [— — — — Οἰτ]αίων καὶ Μαλιέων καὶ [Αἰνιάνων ∶ΙΙΙ∶ — καὶ Ἀγ]ραίων καὶ Δολόπων ∶𐅃 [— — — — — — ∶ Πε]ρραιβῶν ∶ΙΙ [— — — — — ∶ Ζακύνθο]υ καὶ Κεφαληνίας ∶ΙΙΙOitaeans and Malians and Ainianes --and Agraeans and Dolopes---Perrhaebi---Zacynthus and Cephalenia.The decision for the Destruction of Thebes as transgressor of the above oath was taken by the council of the League of Corinth by a large majority.[7] The League is mentioned by Arrian (I, 16, 7), after the Battle of Granicus (334 BC). Alexander sent 300 panoplies to the temple of Pallas Athena in Athens, with the following inscription.During 331 BC after the Battle of Megalopolis, Sparta was forced to join the League of Corinth.[9] During the Asiatic campaign, Antipater was appointed deputy hegemon of the League.[10]The League was dissolved after the Lamian War (322 BC).[11] During 302 BC King Antigonus of Macedon and his son Demetrius Poliorcetes tried to revive the federation against Cassander. Antigonus III Doson (king of Macedon from 229 BC to 221 BC) also revived the League against Sparta during 224 BC.[12]
