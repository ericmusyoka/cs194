Cath Palug, also Cath Paluc, Cath Balug, Cath Balwg, Chapalu, Capalu, or Capalus, literally "Palug's cat", or maybe from the Welsh 'palug,' meaning 'clawing,' was a monstrous cat in French and Welsh legend. It was said to haunt the Isle of Anglesey, and to have killed and eaten nine score warriors.The French versions relate a battle between King Arthur himself and the Chapalu. Sometimes the beast wins, sometimes King Arthur wins.The fight between King Arthur and Cath Palug is figurated on a mosaic in the Cathedral of Otranto[6]The French tradition associates it with the Mont du Chat in the Savoie region of France, near Lake Geneva, where Arthur was defeated by the Cat in a battle fought in a swamp (pallu) near that mountain.The Welsh tradition gives as localisation the Isle of Anglesey but born at Llanveir.The Cath Palug is always localised nearby waterÂ ; lake of Bourget and Lake of Geneva in France, the sea in Wales.
