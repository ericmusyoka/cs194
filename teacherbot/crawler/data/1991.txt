Victor Braunig Lake, formerly known as East Lake, is a reservoir on Calaveras Creek and Chupaderas Creek 17 miles (27 kilometers) south of Downtown San Antonio, Texas, USA. The reservoir was formed in 1962 by the construction of a dam to provide a cooling pond for a power plant to supply additional electrical supply to the city of San Antonio. The dam and lake are managed by CPS Energy of San Antonio. Together with Calaveras Lake, Braunig Lake was one of the first projects in the nation to use treated wastewater for power plant cooling. The reservoir is partly filled with wastewater that has undergone both primary and secondary treatment at a San Antonio Water System treatment plant. Braunig Lake also serves as a venue for recreation, including fishing and boating.Braunig Lake has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Braunig Lake include red drum, hybrid striped bass, catfish, and largemouth bass.Thousand Trails Management Services operates a public park facility at the lake.
