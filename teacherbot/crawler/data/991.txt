Artorius was the family name (nomen) of a Roman gens (the gens Artoria) of obscure and contested etymology.Several Italian scholars consider the name to be of Messapic origin, connecting it with the Messapic gens name Artorres, likely a derivative of the Messapic name Artas (with a Messapic possessive suffix -or-), of uncertain meaning.[1][2][3]An alternative etymology derives it from the praenomen Artor, which may be of Etruscan origin (perhaps a Latinization of the Etruscan name Arnthur).[4][5][6]Some have sought a purely Latin derivation, translating the name as "plowman".[7] Such an etymology seems unlikely as the Latin word for "plowman" was arātor, not *artor (in fact a gentilic name potentially derived from arātor, Arātrius [also an epithet of Jupiter], is attested in inscriptions from Aquileia, Altinum, Pola, and Montefalcone; compare, too the word arātōrius "fit for ploughing", used of oxen and fields).Its members were apparently natives of Campania, and other branches appeared in Dalmatia, Africa, Gallia Narbonensis, and Aegyptus. Marcus, Gaius, and Lucius were the three praenomen used by the Artorii males. Artorius is one suggested source of the name Arthur.[7]Members included:Artorius is also a long poem by John Heath-Stubbs (1972), detailing his view of the Arthurian legend.Wilhelm Schulze, Zur Geschichte lateinischer Eigennamen (Volume 5, Issue 2 of Abhandlungen der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Philologisch-Historische Klasse, Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften Göttingen Philologisch-Historische Klasse) [1]
