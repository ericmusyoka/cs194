The Catholic Historical Review is the official organ of the American Catholic Historical Association. It was established at The Catholic University of America in 1915 by Peter Guilday and is published quarterly by The Catholic University of America Press. The first issue contained a foreword by Cardinal James Gibbons who wrote of the journal that "I bespeak for it a generous welcome by the thoughtful men and women of the country, and bestow my blessing on the unselfish, zealous labors of the devoted Faculty of the Catholic University."[1] Guilday was succeeded as editor by John Tracy Ellis. The journal publishes articles and book reviews received in all areas of ecclesiastical history. In addition to being available in print form, The Catholic Historical Review is also available electronically through Project MUSE.
