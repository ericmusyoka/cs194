15, see textMarmots are large squirrels in the genus Marmota, of which there are 15 species.Some species live in mountainous areas, such as the Alps, northern Apennines, Carpathians, Tatras, and Pyrenees in Europe and northwestern Asia; the Rocky Mountains, Black Hills, the Cascade and Pacific Ranges, and the Sierra Nevada in North America; and the Deosai Plateau in Pakistan and Ladakh in India. Other species prefer rough grassland and can be found widely across North America and the Eurasian Steppe. The similarly-sized but more social prairie dog is not classified in the genus Marmota but in the related genus Cynomys.Marmots typically live in burrows (often within rockpiles, particularly in the case of the yellow-bellied marmot), and hibernate there through the winter. Most marmots are highly social and use loud whistles to communicate with one another, especially when alarmed.Marmots mainly eat greens and many types of grasses, berries, lichens, mosses, roots, and flowers.The following is a list of all Marmota species recognized by Thorington and Hoffman[1] plus the recently defined M. kastschenkoi.[2] They divide marmots into two subgenera.Additionally, four extinct species of marmot are recognized from the fossil record:Marmots have been known since antiquity. Research by the French ethnologist Michel Peissel claimed the story of "gold-digging ants" reported by the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus, who lived in the fifth century BCE, was founded on the golden Himalayan marmot of the Deosai Plateau and the habit of local tribes such as the Brokpa to collect the gold dust excavated from their burrows.[6]The etymology of the term "marmot" is uncertain. It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning "mountain mouse".[7]Beginning in 2010, Alaska celebrates February 2 as "Marmot Day", a holiday intended to observe the prevalence of marmots in that state and take the place of Groundhog Day.[8]Yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris, Tuolumne Meadows, Yosemite National ParkYellow-bellied marmot, near Princeton, British ColumbiaOlympic marmot (Marmota olympus)Groundhog, (Marmota monax), Ottawa, OntarioHoary marmot (Marmota caligata), Mount Rainier National ParkAlpine marmot, Vanoise National Park, French AlpsBlack-capped marmot (Marmota camtschatica)Long-tailed marmot (Marmota caudata), PakistanHimalayan marmot (Marmota himalayanus), BhutanGray marmot (Marmota baibacina), Altai Mountains, KazakhstanTarbagan marmot (Marmota sibirica), Russia and MongoliaDrawing of bobak marmot (Marmota bobak)
