Editors of all abilities and skill are welcome to join:The Theatre of Pompey (Latin: Theatrum Pompeium, Italian: Teatro di Pompeo) was a structure in Ancient Rome built during the later part of the Roman Republic. It was constructed in seven years from 55 BC, and was dedicated early in 52 BC before the structure was fully completed. The theatre was one of the first permanent (non-wooden) theatres in Rome. The building itself was a part of a multi-use complex that included a large quadriporticus directly behind the Scaenae frons. Inclosed by the large columned porticos was an expansive garden complex of fountains and statues. Along the stretch of covered arcade were rooms dedicated to the exposition of art and other works collected by Pompey Magnus during his campaigns.On the opposite end of the garden complex was a curia for political meetings. The senate would often use this building along with a number of temples and halls that satisfied the requirements for them to formally meet. This is infamous as the place of Julius Caesar's murder by the Liberatores of the Roman Senate and elite.The Project Tasks page highlights classics articles that need attention and improvement. The requests from other members section allows editors to specifically request assistance on articles they are writing; you are welcome to add a request from other member. The general backlogs section is an overview of the project's automatically-created indexes of articles.We provide a number of guides for budding classics articles at Guides, including: Writing a Good Article (GA), Writing a Featured Article (FA), and Finding sources and scholarship.We provide a number of templates for improving the reader's experience of classics articles:These stub templates can be placed at the bottom of your very short Classics articles. They will help advertise to Wikipedia's writers (and readers) that the article requires expansion.General {{AncientGreece-stub}} {{AncientRome-stub}}Mythology {{Greek-myth-stub}} {{AncientRome-myth-stub}}People {{AncientRome-bio-stub}} {{AncientGreece-bio-stub}}Battles {{AncientRome-battle-stub}}The WikiProject maintains a number of other useful templates for Classics writers; see Category:Ancient Rome templates and Category:Ancient Greece templates.To invite a new user to the WikiProject, use {{WikiProject Classical Greece and Rome Invitation}}: Teishin (talk) (Pyrrhonism) Kushan I.A.K.J (talk) Cattyboi (talk) (self-taught mythology guy) Katolophyromai (talk) Euphiletos (talk) (BA in Ancient History; MLitt in Greek) Italia2006 (talk) Helmut von Moltke (talk) (interest in study of the Roman Republic, Kingdom, and Empire) Bibliomaniac15 (talk) Eupator (talk) Briangotts (talk) 5telios (talk) Alain08 (talk) Aldux (talk) Alektor89 (talk) (currently finishing my M.Ed. in Latin Philology/History and studying Greek Philology) Amadscientist (talk) Yannismarou (talk) SparrowHK (talk) Ferkelparade (talk) Pmanderson (talk) Andrew Dalby (talk) InfernoXV (talk) (Low-level Byzantinist and Classicist, palaeographer) Nicknack009 (talk) Akhilleus (talk) Neddyseagoon (talk) Andonic (talk) Paul August (talk) AGK (talk) Amit6 (talk) Delirium (talk) Daddylight (talk) DIEGO73 (talk) (Ancient Greek mythology, culture and language, Classical Greece) Amphytrite (talk) EALacey (talk) (Roman Imperial history, Latin lit.)
