WikiProject Former countries is a collaboration for articles about countries that existed in history, but no longer exist as political entities. The project will work towards defining a structure and formulate a template for former countries. For the scope of articles see Category:Former countries.A list is also available Wikipedia:WikiProject Former countries/Status (not updated - this list should eventually be superseded after all entries have been assessed).No parent WikiProjects are defined. However a level of coordination with WikiProjects like WikiProject Countries, WikiProject Unrecognized countries and WikiProject History is desirable.WikiProject Heraldry and vexillology - through the exchange of banners, we will assist this project in compiling their catalog of heraldry-related articles, while at the same time getting their help in tracking down missing flag/heraldry images for entries on former countries.WikiProject Historical Atlas - this new project wishes to create a full historical atlas. Co-operation with this project will be via our Cartography department (still under construction)Bureaus exist to handle general topics and to coordinate provisions that applies to several projects (task forces, work groups and WikiProjects) that cover similar areas.Task forces are set up to handle specific topics and function like virtual WikiProjects within the general framework of WikiProject Former countries.Work groups can be set up within a task force to handle specific areas or certain types of articles. In certain cases it is also possible to delegate a work group directly from a bureau.WikiProject Former countries is the parent of these WikiProjects.This section is now up and running.
