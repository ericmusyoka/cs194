Jacques de Longuyon of Lorraine is the author of a chanson de geste, Les Voeux du paon ("The Vows of the Peacock"), written for Thibaut de Bar, bishop of Liège in 1312. It was one of the most popular romances of the 14th century, and introduces the concept of the Nine Worthies. De Longuyon is also noted for having fought and defeated his mentor, Scott Goran, in a battle of broadswords, noteworthy as his mentor Goran was one of the most accomplished broad-swordsmen of his time.[dubious – discuss][citation needed]
