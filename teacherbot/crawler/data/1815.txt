Geoghegan supports the National Popular Vote compact for presidential elections[5] on the grounds that it would increase electoral responsiveness, transparency and accountability.[6] He urges a reform of the redistricting of US congressional districts, arguing that currently over than 90% of Congressional seats are "safe", such that no challenger has a serious chance of unseating an incumbent and this discourages voter participation. He argues against the filibuster in the US Senate as undemocratic and unconstitutional under current rules.
