Thomas Brattle •The Politics and Government Work Group is a working group of members of the Biography WikiProject dedicated to ensuring quality and coverage of biography articles.                    Since biographies are potentially under the purview of almost all WikiProjects, it is important that we work in tandem with these projects. Also, when seeking collaboration on articles, don't neglect to approach WikiProjects that are part of the geographical region your subject is/was in.Increase the exposure of our work group by nominating our articles for their Portal FA and DYKs...
