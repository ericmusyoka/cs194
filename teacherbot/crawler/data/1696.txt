The history of Persian Egypt is divided into three eras:Egypt was a rich country, and the Persians had coveted it for more than a millennium. It had been conquered twice by the Achaemenids (525–404 and 343–332 bce, until Alexander's conquest), but the stable and powerful Ptolemaic kingdom, and then the Roman Empire, kept away Persians from Egypt for much of the Greek, Roman, and Byzantine periods. But the expansionist designs of the Sasanian King Khosrow II (590–628), taking advantage of a troubled period on the Byzantine side, allowed Persians under the command of Shahrbaraz to conquer Egypt once again (among other parts of the Near East), for a short period (619–629).[1]
