He was Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Chicago where he had taught since 1947.[2] He was also the father of historian J. R. McNeill with whom he co-authored The Human Web: A Bird's-eye View of World History.[3]William McNeill was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the son of theologian and educator John T. McNeill. He was educated at the University of Chicago, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1938 and Master of Arts (M.A.) in 1939. In 1941, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in World War II in the European theater.[4] After the war, he obtained his PhD at Cornell University, in 1947.[2]In 1947, McNeill began teaching at the University of Chicago, which became his home throughout his professional career.McNeill's most popular work, completed early in his career, is The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community (1963).[5] The book explored world history in terms of the effect of different old world civilizations on one another, and especially the dramatic effect of Western civilization on others in the past 500 years. It had a major impact on historical theory, especially its emphasis on cultural fusions, in contrast to Oswald Spengler's view of discrete, independent civilizations.McNeill's Rise of the West won the 1964 U.S. National Book Award in History and Biography.[6] His Plagues and Peoples (1976), was an important early contribution to the impact of disease on human history and contributed to the emergence of environmental history as a discipline.[citation needed]McNeill was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama on February 25, 2010. The citation recognizes "his exceptional talent as a teacher and scholar at the University of Chicago and as an author of more than 20 books, including The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community (1963), which traces civilizations through 5,000 years of recorded history."[7]McNeill was married to Elizabeth Darbishire[8] until her death in 2006.McNeill died in July 2016, at the age of 98.[9]
