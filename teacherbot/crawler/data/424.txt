Abu Muhammad 'Abd al-Malik bin Hisham ibn Ayyub al-Himyari (Arabic: أبو محمد عبدالمالك بن هشام‎‎), or Ibn Hisham edited the biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad written by Ibn Ishaq.[1] Ibn Ishaq's work is lost and is now only known in the recensions of Ibn Hisham and al-Tabari.[2] He was also said to have mastered Arabic philology in a way which only Sibawayh had.[3]Ibn Hisham has been said to have grown up in Basra and moved afterwards to Egypt,[4] while others have narrated that his family was descended from Basra but he himself was born in Old Cairo.[5] Either way, it is in Egypt where he gained a name as a grammarian and student of language and history. His family was of Himyarite origin, though some narrators trace him to Mu'afir ibn Ya'far, while others say he is a Dhuhli.[4]
