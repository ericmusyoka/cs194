A group of Wikipedians have formed this project to better organize and improve the quality and accuracy in the articles related to ancient Dacia and primarily to the history of Dacians, Getae and Moesi.This project and its subpages contain the suggestions of the participating Wikipedians and it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of others. If you would like to help, please inquire on the talk page and review the Tasks below.For more information on WikiProjects, please see Wikipedia:WikiProjects and Wikipedia:WikiProject best practices.The scope of the project includes the following elements:Your input on greater clarification on the scope is greatly appreciated, if you wish to comment make a new section on our Talk pageWe at WikiProject on Dacia work together to reach the following goals:More completed tasks...For a full list, visit the Recognized content page....more...more...moreBelow is a list of newly created articles or articles under serious work. Feel free to add yours and ask for help.Below is a list of articles not ready for prime time, which are kept in the project space. Some of them were already removed due to lack of notability or content. You can help expand them and bring them (back) to the main space. To avoid speedy deletion of new/incomplete articles or to try to reach WP:DYK with some articles, it is advised to create the articles first as subpages of Drafts or in your user space.Pages with the prefix 'WikiProject_Dacia/Drafts' in the 'Wikipedia' and 'Wikipedia talk' namespaces:Please help with our current collaboration on this subject: Dacian languageSince there are many possibilities and theories around Dacians and their language, we are proposing to all involved to use their creativity, knowledge and energy in creating separate articles for different language affinities.It is suggested to avoid changing the main Dacian language article, the origins of Dacian tribes, the maps of Dacia and the Wikipedia language tree without prompting conversations on corresponding talk pages and thoroughly verifying sources. Please pay attention to not introduce original research and to keep a neutral point of view, per Wikipedia policies and guidelines. As an alternative, it is suggested that you expand or create these articles, using as much academic evidence you can gather:Once these separate articles went through scrutiny and review, please propose the addition of links or sections about the various theories into the main articles, and/or prompt collaborative discussion for changes to important maps.Thanks for your support!This list includes formally registered members of the project.
