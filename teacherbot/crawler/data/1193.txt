An anthropologist is a person engaged in the practice of anthropology. Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies.[1][2][3] Social anthropology and cultural anthropology[1][2][3] study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology[1][2][3] studies the biological development of humans.Anthropologists usually cover a breadth of topics within anthropology in their undergraduate education, and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the graduate level. In some universities, a qualifying exam serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of anthropology; the students who pass are permitted to work on a doctoral dissertation.Some notable anthropologists include: Edward Burnett Tylor, James George Frazer, Franz Boas, Bronisław Malinowski, Elsie Clews Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Margaret Mead, Zora Neale Hurston, Ruth Benedict, Ella Deloria, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Clifford Geertz, and Paul Rabinow.
