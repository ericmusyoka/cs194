From 2015 to 2016, Comal County, sixth on the list, grew by 5,675 newcomers, or 4.4 percent. Kendall County, the second-fastest-growing county in the nation, grew by 5.16 percent.

In return, they were to receive $12,000 in money, livestock, equipment and provisions for a year. After the first year, the colonies were expected to support themselves.[24] The colonies attempted were Castell,[25] Leiningen, Bettina,[26] Schoenburg and Meerholz in Llano County; Darmstädler Farm in Comal County; and Tusculum in Kendall County.[27] Of these, only Castell survives. The colonies failed after the Adelsverein funding expired, and also due to conflict of structure and authorities. Some members moved to other Adelsverein settlements in Texas. Others moved elsewhere, or returned to Germany.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 575 square miles (1,490 km2), of which 559 square miles (1,450 km2) is land and 15 square miles (39 km2) (2.7%) is water.[28]The Balcones Escarpment runs northeastward through the county, generally just west of Interstate 35.
